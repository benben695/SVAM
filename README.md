## 📌 Overview

SVAM (Smart Village Agri Monitor) is a low-cost, intelligent agricultural assistant built to empower smallholder farmers in remote regions. It uses AI running on low-power edge devices like Raspberry Pi to provide real-time crop disease diagnosis and soil health advice — all without internet access.

---

## 🌱 Inspiration

In many parts of rural Africa, lack of access to agricultural extension services and internet connectivity leads to crop loss, pest outbreaks, and poor yields. During a community outreach, we met farmers who couldn’t identify or treat diseases early, resulting in devastating losses. SVAM was born to close this gap — bringing the power of AI to the farm, even where the grid can’t reach.

## 🧠 What It Does

- ✅ **Crop Disease Diagnosis** – Detect plant diseases from leaf images using offline computer vision.
- 🧪 **Soil Health Checker** – Input soil test readings or visuals and get fertility analysis + nutrient recommendations.
- 🎧 **Voice Support** – Multilingual audio guidance in local dialects for non-literate users.
- 📅 **Offline Farming Tips** – Seasonal advice and yield-boosting techniques preloaded for anytime access.
